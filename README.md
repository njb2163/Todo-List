# Todo-List

## Prerequisites   

Before running you will need to make sure all Python dependencies are downloaded on your local. The only dependency currently is `flask`

`flask` can be downloaded by running:
```
pip install flask
```

## How to Run
Start the flask server with:  
```
python server.py
```

Then navigate to the url where the flask app is running. You can find this location from the logs when you start the server.  

For example, on my computer the server starts on `http://127.0.0.1:5000`
